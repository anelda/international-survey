Record who has been contacted and when, when sending the invitation to fill the survey! It's important to understand the results finally.

Aim to release the German survey by mid or end of August and close it by end of September.
  - Consider time to set-up and test final LimeSurvey
  - Make use of RSE17 publicity to spread invitation for survey
